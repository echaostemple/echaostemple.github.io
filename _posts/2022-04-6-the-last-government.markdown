Since i was young, i've always watched corrupted villains want to rule the world and make themselves the only government and usually their evil plans are stopped by the heroes. Few years later, i've started to notice that this is what's happening.

I don't believe in conspiracy theories, at least 98% of them. And, the ones that i believe in are not "theories", they are real. Like the fact that money was backed by gold and now it's backed by nothing. But, we're not talking about this now. The term "Agenda 2030" might have come up in a Youtube video or a tweet, and you may have said that it's bullshit. But, it's actually an agenda approved by the UN and here is the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">link </a>.

***But, where are the heroes?***

It may seem fine at first glance, but if you focus you can notice that it's a disaster.
